# 微信读书优化流程

## Scope

Process a project folder into a separate output folder for 微信读书:

- primary output: WeRead-friendly EPUB
- supported public script inputs: `.html`, `.htm`, `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.webp`
- preserve body text, headings, paragraphs, lists, quotes, code blocks, tables, comparison grids, and body images where extractable
- keep body images near their original positions; do not dump images at the end
- remove obvious page/web noise such as navigation, sidebars, comments, buttons, ads, logos, and decorative page furniture
- detect video/audio/iframe/mp4 rich media and never silently omit it

Run the bundled script with `workdir` set to the user’s source folder:

```powershell
python -X utf8 scripts/weread_optimize.py
```

The script processes the current directory unless `WEREAD_INPUT_DIR` is set.

## HTML Collection Mode

Use this when the user wants one combined book from multiple HTML files:

```powershell
$env:WEREAD_HTML_ONLY='1'
$env:WEREAD_COMBINE_HTML='1'
$env:WEREAD_COLLECTION_TITLE='合集标题'
python -X utf8 scripts/weread_optimize.py
```

The script sorts numbered files by leading number, creates one EPUB, and inserts a visible chapter title at the start of every chapter body.

## Required First Steps

1. Count source files and extensions in the current folder.
2. If the user says there should be N numbered files, parse leading numbers and report missing/duplicate/unparseable numbers before finalizing.
3. Check runtime availability and install missing packages if needed:
   - `pymupdf` for PDF
   - `Pillow` for image metadata
   - `beautifulsoup4` for HTML cleanup
4. If source files are DOCX/MOBI/PPT, convert them to HTML or PDF first, then run this skill.

## Validation Checklist

After conversion:

1. Confirm EPUB count vs manifest count.
2. Confirm failures are zero, or list failed files with reasons.
3. Spot-check EPUB zip entries and image references when images are extracted.
4. Confirm `处理报告.md` includes source count, missing/duplicate numbered files, rich-media handling, scan/image-page handling, and output list.
5. Provide links to the output folder, EPUB folder, and report.

## Interaction/Rich Media Rule

If video/audio/iframe/mp4 is found:

- state that 微信读书 EPUB cannot fully preserve those interactive components
- state how they were handled: static text/images retained; interaction not embedded; note inserted in the corresponding EPUB
- do not imply full fidelity

## Scan/OCR Limitation Rule

If PDF pages have no text layer or the source is an image:

- preserve them as page images so they can be viewed and enlarged
- mark them as scan/image pages in `处理报告.md`
- clearly state that 微信读书 voice playback cannot fully read those pages
- do not claim complete text extraction unless OCR was actually run

## Final Response Pattern

Keep final concise:

- what was produced
- counts
- any failed/limited files
- links to output artifacts

Do not ask the user to re-upload if the current folder or file library already contains the same files; continue from local files whenever possible.
